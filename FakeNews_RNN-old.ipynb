    "# Build an RNN to identify unreliable news articles\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook applies an RNN to identify when an article might be fake news. The data were obtained from the [Fake News Competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news). \n",
    "\n",
    ">Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance on real test set from Kaggle:** My Kaggle submission resulted in **92.09%** for private score and  **91.41%** for public score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Credit:** This is a side project for [PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship), which uses the [Sentiment_RNN](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/sentiment-rnn/Sentiment_RNN_Solution.ipynb) template from the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minhkhang1795/FakeNews_RNN/master/assets/network_diagram.png\" width=40%>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**First, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer.** We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the Word2Vec lesson. You can actually train an embedding with the Skip-gram Word2Vec model and use those embeddings as input, here. However, it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn a different embedding table on its own. *In this case, the embedding layer is for dimensionality reduction, rather than for learning semantic representations.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">**After input words are passed to an embedding layer, the new embeddings will be passed to LSTM cells.** The LSTM cells will add *recurrent* connections to the network and give us the ability to include information about the *sequence* of words in the article data. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Finally, the LSTM outputs will go to a sigmoid output layer.** We're using a sigmoid function because positive (or fake news) = 1 and negative = 0, and a sigmoid will output predicted, sentiment values between 0-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the **very last one**; we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the loss by comparing the output at the last time step and the training label (pos or neg).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load and visualize the data\n",
    "**train.csv**: A full training dataset with the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **id**: unique id for a news article\n",
    "- **title**: the title of a news article\n",
    "- **author**: author of the news article\n",
    "- **text**: the text of the article; could be incomplete\n",
    "- **label**: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable\n",
    "    - 1: unreliable\n",
    "    - 0: reliable\n"
